# Prediction of the Produced Electrical Power from a Combined Cycle Power Plant
Modern power plants, especially Combined Cycle Power Plants (CCPP), play a crucial role in energy production. These plants utilize both gas and steam turbines to improve overall efficiency. In a CCPP, ambient environmental conditions such as temperature, pressure, and humidity significantly influence the plant's operational efficiency and power output. Understanding the relationships between these parameters and energy output is vital for plant optimization, predictive maintenance, and long-term planning. This project leverages a real-world dataset collected over six years to study these interactions. It not only involves data visualization and exploration but also employs regression techniques to model the system's behavior and predict power generation.

The project is divided into two key parts:
- **Hypothesis Testing**  
  - Determine the average value of the ambient temperature.  
  - Understand its behavior and variability over time.

- **Regression Modeling**  
  - Study the influence of internal parameters (temperature, pressure, humidity, vacuum) on net electrical output.  
  - Build and evaluate regression models to predict energy production.


The dataset used in this project has been widely adopted in machine learning research for benchmarking regression algorithms, as it reflects realistic physical constraints and sensor readings. By applying both hypothesis testing and regression modeling, this project attempts to:
- Provide insights into which environmental factors most affect power output.
- Help power plant engineers make informed decisions using data-driven insights.
- Serve as a case study in applying machine learning to energy systems.
